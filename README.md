## *A Breach Breakdown: The Calm Before the Compromise*



**Motivation**



&nbsp;	The Motivation behind my Cybersecurity Attacks Capstone is that I want to emphasize the importance of data security. My educational background influenced my interest in The Washington Data Breach. I have a Masterâ€™s Degree in Business Administration concentrating in Cybersecurity Management. Data Breaches impact your personal information due to exposing sensitive details such as health, location, and financial information. Due to these vulnerabilities, it can increase fraud or identity theft. In organizations, it can cause incident response costs, legal ramification, system malfunction, and fees to fix or replace damaged devices. For healthcare organizations, it can cause violations of data protection laws such as HIPAA. Unfortunately, utilizing cybersecurity practices often come after a business or person has encountered a data breach. My goal is to influence the way we view cybersecurity and make it part of our daily practice rather than a damage control process. In my capstone project, I will visually expose the different types of data breaches that occurred in the Washington Data Breach between 2016-2025. Cybersecurity attacks affect business, health, and financial industries, and much more. I want to uncover the impacts of the Washington Data Breach and offer tools to help prevent these attacks in the future. Making a difference by protecting one individual, or organization, and or our community from data breach vulnerabilities would be a significant achievement for my capstone.



**Data Questions**



What types of cyber-attacks occurred in Washingtonian Data Breach?

Which year had the most data breaches?

Where the Washington residents the only people affected by the data breach?



**Technologies Used**

&nbsp;

In this project I utilized Python for data analysis, cleaning, and applied logic to help generate a validated csv file for seamless import into Power BI. I loaded and transformed the data within Power BI to develop interactive visualizations and insights.
